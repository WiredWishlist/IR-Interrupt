IR Sensor Object Detection using ESP32 and Interrupts

This project detects objects using an IR sensor connected to an ESP32 board. It uses hardware interrupts to print "Object detected" whenever an object is detected by the IR sensor.

⚙ Connections:

IR Sensor OUT → GPIO 14 of ESP32

IR Sensor VCC → 3.3V of ESP32

IR Sensor GND → GND of ESP32
